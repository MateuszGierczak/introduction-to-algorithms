# The role of algorithm in computing

> 1.1-1 Give a real-world example that requires sorting or a real-world example that requires computing a convex hull.
- Sorting: phone book in smartphones, application list in smartphones, prices e.g. in website of restaurant
- Convex hull: animal area of occurence based on GPS position where it was seen, collision avoidance system detects obstacles and computes a path that avoid collision 

> 1.1-2 Other than speed, what other measures of efficiency might one use in a real-world setting?
- memory consumption
- resource consumption (cpu or gpu)
- number of generated assembly code

> 1.1-3 Select a data structure that you have seen previously, and discuss its strengths and limitations.


> 1.1-4 How are the shortest-path and traveling-salesman problems given above similar? How are they different?


> 1.1-5 Come up with a real-world problem in which only the best solution will do. Then come up with one in which a solution that is "approximately" the best is good enough.
