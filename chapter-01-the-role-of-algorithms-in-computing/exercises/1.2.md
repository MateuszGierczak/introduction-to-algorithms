# The role of algorithm in computing

> 1.2-1 Give an example of an application that requires algorithmic content at the application level, and discuss the function of the algorithms involved.

> 1.2-2 Suppose we are comparing implementations of insertion sort and merge sort on the same machine. For inputs of size $n$ , insertion sort runs in $8n^2$ steps, while merge sort runs in $64n\lg n$ steps. For which values of $n$ does insertion sort beat merge sort?

insertion sort < merge sort

$8n^2 < 64n\lg n$ $/:8$

$n^2 < 8n\lg n$ $/:n$

$n < lg\ n^8$ $/ N\lg\ a = lg\ (a^N)$

If we draw $f(x) = n$ and $f(x) = lg\ n^8$ functions on one plot and make assumption that logarithm base is equal to 10 we will see that insertion sort beats merge sort for n >= 1 and n <= 43

> 1.2-3 What is the smallest value of $n$ such that an algorithm whose running time is $100n^2$ runs faster than an algorithm whose running time is $2^n$ on the same machine?
