> For each function $f(n)$ and time $t$ in the following table, determine the largest size $n$ of a problem that can be solved in time $t$, assuming that the algorithm to solve the problem takes $f(n)$ microseconds.

.          |  1 second  |     1 minute    | 1 hour | 1 day | 1 month | 1 year | 1 century |
---------- | ---------- | --------------- | ------ | ----- | ------- | ------ | --------- | 
$\lg n$    | $2^{10^6}$ | $2^{60 * 10^6}$ |  |  |  |  |  | 
$\sqrt{n}$ | $10^{12}$  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 
$n$        | $10^{6}$   |  |  |  |  |  |  | 
$n\lg n$   |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 
$n^2$      |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 
$n^3$      |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 
$2^n$      |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 
$n!$       |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 

e.g. <br>
$f(n) = \lg n$ <br>
1 second $= \lg n$ <br>
$10^6$ microseconds = $\lg n$ <br>
$2^{10^6} = n$
